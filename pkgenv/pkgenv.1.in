.SH NAME
pkgenv \- simple package environment manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
pkgenv [ -hv ] [ -p \fIpkgdir\fP ] [ -s \fIshell\fP ] { add | del | list | avail } [ \fIpackage\fP ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBpkgenv\fP utility automatically configures the shell
environment for software packages via package environment descriptor
(`.pkgenv') files. \fBpkgenv\fP is a leaner, simpler alternative to the
\fBEnvironment Modules\fP package.

A pkgenv descriptor file is a simple text file containing directives
that describe how the shell environment should be modified for the
corresponding software package. The following directives are available:

.TP 5
\fCadjust \fIpath\fP [ \fIpath\fP ... ]\fP
Indicates that the default adjustments should be made to the listed
\fIpath\fP environment variable(s). The supported path environment
variables, and the default adjustments that are made to them, are as
follows:

.RS 5
.TP 24
.B PATH
Prepend the package's `bin' directory, if it exists.
.TP
.B LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Prepend the package's `lib' directory, if it exists.
.TP
.B  DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
The Mac OS X equivalent of \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fP.
.TP
.B MANPATH
Prepend the package's 'man' and/or `share/man' directories, whichever exist.
.TP
.B PKG_CONFIG_PATH
Prepend the package's `lib/pkgconfig' directory, if it exists.
.TP
.B ACLOCAL_PATH
Prepend the package's `share/aclocal' directory, if it exists.
.P
(The \fCadjust\fP directive cannot be used with environment variables
other than those listed above.)

For most software packages, the modifications provided by this
directive will be sufficient. If they are not, more fine-tuned control is
possible with the remaining directives.
.RS -5
.TP 5
\fIvariable\fP \fC=\fP \fIvalue\fP
Sets the environment variable \fIvariable\fP to the value
\fIvalue\fP. Only variables other than the path variables supported by
the \fCadjust\fP directive may be used; this is to prevent accidental
clobbering of those variables.
.TP 5
\fIpath\fP \fC+=\fP \fIvalue\fP
Prepends the directory \fIvalue\fP to the path environment variable
\fIpath\fP, which must be one of the path environment variables listed
above.
.TP 5
\fIpath\fP \fC.=\fP \fIvalue\fP
Appends the directory \fIvalue\fP to the path environment variable
\fIpath\fP, which must be one of the path environment variables listed
above.

.P
For all three of the assignment directives (`=', `+=', and `.='),
variable substitution is performed on \fIvalue\fP. A variable is
referenced as `\fC${\fP\fIname\fP\fC}\fP', where \fIname\fP may be one of the
following, or the name of any environment variable.

.TP 10
\fCroot\fP
The root directory of the software package, for example `/pkg/gcc-3.3'.
.TP 10
\fCprefix\fP
Equivalent to \fCroot\fP.
.TP 10
\fCname\fP
The name of the package, for example `gcc'.
.TP 10
\fCversion\fP
The version of the package, for example `3.3'.
.P
Any lines in the descriptor file consisting of only whitespace, or
containing non-whitespace text that begins with a `#' character, are
ignored.

.SH OPTIONS
The following options are recognized:
.TP 10
.B -h
Display a command synopsis and copyright message and exit.
.TP
.B -v
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.B -V
Enable verbose mode.
.TP
.B -p \fIpkgroot\fP
Specify \fIpkgroot\fP as the package root. The default package root is
`/pkg'.
.TP
.B -s \fIshell\fP
Specify \fIshell\fP as the shell for which environment statements will
be output. Possible values are `sh', `bash', `ksh', `zsh', `csh', and
`tcsh'.
.SH COMMANDS
The commands supported by the \fBpkgenv\fP utility are as follows:
.TP 10
\fCadd\fI
Adds the named package(s) to the environment.
.TP
\fCdel\fI
Removes the named package(s) from the environment.
.TP
\fClist\fI
Prints a list of packages that are currently active in the environment.
.TP
\fCavail\fI
Prints a list of available packages that match the listed names, or if
no names are specified, a list of all available packages.
.P
.SH FILES
To be used with \fBpkgenv\fP, software packages must be installed on
the system under a common package root directory, which by default is
`/pkg', but may be overridden via either the \fB-p\fP command line
switch or the \fBPKGENV_ROOT\fP environment variable. Each package
should be installed beneath the package root within its own directory,
with a name that reflects the package name and version in the form
\fIname\fP-\fIversion\fP, e.g., `gcc-3.3'.

The descriptor files must reside in a subdirectory of the package root
named `PKGENV'. Each descriptor file must have a name of the form
\fIname\fP-\fIversion\fP.pkgenv, e.g., `gcc-3.3.pkgenv'.

\fBpkgenv\fP writes the shell commands for modifying the environment
into the file `.pkgenv' in the user's home directory. These must then
be executed by the shell for the changes to take effect. This is done
by defining a shell alias which runs \fBpkgenv\fP and then
evaluates the contents of the resulting file.

For \fBcsh/tcsh\fP the alias is:

.RS 5
\fCalias pkg 'pkgenv \\!* && eval `cat ~/.pkgenv`'\fP
.RS -5

For \fBsh/bash\fP the alias is:

.RS 5
\fCfunction pkg ()
  { pkgenv $@ && eval "`cat "$HOME/.pkgenv"`"; }
\fP
.RS -5

For \fBzsh\fP the alias is:

.RS 5
\fCalias pkg='pkgenv $@ && eval `cat ~/.pkgenv`'\fP
.RS -5

For \fBksh\fP the alias is:

.RS 5
\fCpkg ()
  { pkgenv $@ && eval "`cat "$HOME/.pkgenv"`"; }
\fP
.RS -5

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
\fBpkgenv\fP uses the following environment variables:
.TP 15
.B SHELL
To determine the user's shell. Overridden by the \fB-s\fP switch.
.TP
.B PKGENV_ROOT
The package root directory. Overridden by the \fB-p\fP switch.
.TP
.B PKGENV_CURRENT
To maintain the list of currently active packages.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example shows a possible pkgenv descriptor for Sun's
JDK. This descriptor would be stored in a file with a name like
\fI/pkg/PKGENV/jdk-1.5.0.pkgenv\fP.

.nf
\fCadjust PATH MANPATH

LD_LIBRARY_PATH += ${root}/jre/lib/i386:${root}/jre/lib/i386/server
LD_LIBRARY_PATH += ${root}/jre/lib/i386/native_threads

JAVA_HOME = ${root}
\fP
.fi

.SH NOTES
The \fBaclocal\fP program does not normally recognize the
\fBACLOCAL_PATH\fP environment variable; the \fIautomake\fP package must be
patched to add this support. The patch is available here:
\fIhttp://www.nabble.com/ACLOCAL_PATH-t4271240.html\fP

The default installation directory for man pages, as specified by the
GNU Coding Standards, was previously `man'; it is now `share/man'.
