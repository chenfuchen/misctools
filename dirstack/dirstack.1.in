.SH NAME
dirstack \- directory browser/selector
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdirstack\fP [ \fB-hnpq\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBdirstack\fP utility is an interactive directory browser. It
maintains a `stack' of directories as do the \fBpushd\fP/\fBpopd\fP
commands of some shells, but in a visual, scrollable list.

When \fBdirstack\fP is run, it optionally adds the current working
directory to the top of the stack (if the \fB-p\fP switch is
supplied). If the current directory is already on the stack, it moves it
to the top of the stack. It then displays a \fIcurses\fP-based text
interface which shows the directory stack as a scrollable list.

A directory may be selected from the list with the keyboard, or--on
those terminals that support mouse input--with the mouse. The
following commands are recognized:
.TP 5
.B Down-Arrow or j
Any of these keys will move the highlight down to the next directory
in the list, scrolling the list if necessary.
.TP 5
.B Up-Arrow or k
Any of these keys will move the highlight up to the previous directory in the list, scrolling the list if necessary.
.TP 5
.B Right-Arrow, n, or Next-Page
Any of these keys will show the next screenful of directories.
.TP 5
.B Left-Arrow, p, or Prev-Page
Any of these keys will show the previous screenful of directories.
.TP 5
.B Backspace or d
Any of these keys will remove the currently-highlighted directory from the stack. If there is only one directory left on the stack, the command is ignored.
.TP 5
.B Return or Space
Any of these keys will accept the currently selected directory and exit the program.
.TP 5
.B ^L
Pressing this key will cause a full screen repaint.
.TP 5
.B q
This key will exit the program without accepting the selected directory.
.TP 0

On terminals that support mouse input, the mouse can be used to scroll
the list and select a directory. Single-clicking on a directory will
select the directory. Double-clicking on a directory will select and
accept the directory. Clicking on a ``--more--'' line has the same
effect as paging up or down in the corresponding direction.

\fBdirstack\fP must be integrated with the shell via shell aliases.

For \fBcsh/tcsh\fP the aliases are:

.RS 5
\fCalias ds 'dirstack && cd `cat ~/.dirstacksel`'

alias dspush 'dirstack -pn'
\fP
.RS -5

For \fBbash\fP the aliases are:

.RS 5
\fCfunction ds ()
  { dirstack && cd "`cat "$HOME/.dirstacksel"`"; }

alias dspush='dirstack -pn'
\fP
.RS -5

For \fBzsh\fP the aliases are:

.RS 5
\fCalias ds='dirstack && cd `cat ~/.dirstacksel`'

alias dspush='dirstack -pn'
\fP
.RS -5

For \fBksh\fP the aliases are:

.RS 5
\fCds ()
  { dirstack && cd "`cat "$HOME/.dirstacksel"`"; }

alias dspush='dirstack -pn'
\fP
.RS -5

Once the alias is defined, \fBdirstack\fP is used by invoking the
alias rather than by running the binary directly.

.SH OPTIONS
The following command line options are recognized:
.TP 5
.B -h
Display a command synopsis and copyright message, and exit.
.TP 5
.B -n
Do not start the browser (no stack display).
.TP 5
.B -p
Push the current directory onto the stack.
.TP 5
.B -q
Run quietly: do not beep the terminal in response to invalid keypresses.
.SH NOTES
There is presently no error checking to determine if any given
directory actually exists and/or is accessible.

\fBdirstack\fP will not run on a screen smaller than 40x10.
.SH FILES
