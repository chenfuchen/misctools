.SH NAME
textlock \- password-lock a terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtextlock\fP [ \fB-h\fP ]

\fBtlpasswd\fP
.SH AVAILABILITY
This program will not run on an ASCII terminal which is smaller than 40
columns by 15 rows. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBtextlock\fP utility locks an ASCII terminal until the user who
invoked it enters their password at the keyboard. While the terminal
is locked, a clock is displayed at random locations on the screen. If
a key is pressed, the program displays a dialog box in which the user
is expected to enter their password. If an invalid password is
entered, or if no input is received after a certain amount of time,
the program reverts back to the clock display. The program cannot be
interrupted with any of the keyboard-generated interrupts (for
example, control-C, break, control-Z, and control-Y).

By default, the user's system password will unlock the
display. However, the user may specify an alternate password to use
for unlocking the display by running the \fBtlpasswd\fP program. This
program asks for a new password and stores an encrypted version of the
password in the file \fI.textlock\fP in the user's home
directory. \fBtextlock\fP reverts to verifying against the user's
system password only if the \fI.textlock\fP file does not exist.
.SH OPTIONS
Without any options, \fBtextlock\fP immediately locks the screen. With
the \fI-h\fP option, it displays usage and credits
information.

Several key commands are available in the password editing box. These are
summarized below (`^' denotes the `CONTROL' key).
.TP 5
.B Backspace, Delete, or Left-Arrow
Any of these keys will delete the character to the left of the cursor.
.TP 5
.B ^U or Clear-Line
These keys will clear the entire editing line and reposition the cursor at
the beginning.
.TP 5
.B ^L or Refresh
These keys will cause the entire screen to be refreshed. This option is
useful if a password entry is interrupted by a broadcast message.
.TP 5
.B Return or Enter
These keys will accept the current entry.
.TP 5
.B Space-Bar
This key will abort the input and return to the clock display.
.TP 5
.B ^T
This is an escape code that specifies that the following keycode
should be treated literally. This is useful for entering passwords
that contain embedded control characters. Any character may be entered
after a ^T, including another ^T.

.TP 0
The \fBtlpasswd\fP utility accepts no options.
.SH NOTES
Due to the security concerns posed by a user entering his or her password
into a running program, \fBtextlock\fP takes some precautions about
handling this information. A static buffer is used to hold the user's
password input, and this buffer is erased immediately after the
input is encrypted for comparison against the actual encrypted
password.

Another security problem would arise if \fBtextlock\fP were to dump
core immediately after the user entered their password, since the core
file (process image) could be examined to find the password. To
prevent this from happening, \fBtextlock\fP reroutes every signal
which could cause a core dump to a special signal handler. This
handler zeroes the input buffer and then exits gracefully. In most
cases this will prevent a core dump altogether.
.SH FILES

.SH BUGS
The \fBtlpasswd\fP program may not properly handle the input of
control characters and escape sequences as part of a
password. Additionally, only the first 8 characters of the password
are significant.
