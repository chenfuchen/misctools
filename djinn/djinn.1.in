.SH NAME
djinn \- UNIX daemon wrapper for Java programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdjinn\fP [\fB-j\fP \fIjvm\fP] [[\fB-J\fP \fIarg\fP] ...]
[\fB-p\fP \fIclasspath\fP] [\fB-o\fP \fIlogfile\fP]
[\fB--help --version --verbose\fP] \fIclass\fP [\fIarg\fP ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBdjinn\fP is a simple C wrapper program that allows a Java program
to run as a daemon. It invokes the Java Virtual Machine on the named
\fIclass\fP in a subprocess that has no standard I/O streams and no
controlling terminal. Any arguments which follow the class name are
passed to the \fBmain()\fP function in the class. This subprocess is
created as the leader of its own process group, and its signal mask is
modified to ignore the \fBSIGHUP\fP signal.

The absolute path to the Java Virtual Machine may be specified on the
command line or through the \fBJAVA\fP environment variable, with the
command line switch taking precedence. If neither of these is
specified, \fBdjinn\fP attempts to locate an executable named "java" in the 
binary search path, and if successful, uses that as the JVM.

After spawning the JVM, if \fBdjinn\fP detects that the JVM
immediately exited with an error, it writes a message to that effect
to standard error; any messages from the JVM itself will be available
in the log file, if one has been specified.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 5
.B --help
Display a command synopsis and exit.
.TP 5
.B --version
Display the program's version information and exit.
.TP 5
.B --verbose
Run in verbose mode.
.TP 5
.B -j \fIjvm\fP
Specify the absolute path to the Java VM executable. If this switch is
omitted, \fBdjinn\fP will check the \fBJAVA\fP environment variable,
and if that does not contain the path of an executable file, it will
attempt to find a program named ``java'' in the binary search path, and
use that as the JVM.
.TP 5
.B -J \fIarg\fP
Pass the argument \fIarg\fP to the Java Virtual
Machine. If several arguments need to be passed, this switch may be repeated.
The argument \fIarg\fP should be enclosed in quotes to prevent the
shell from interpreting it as a switch to \fBdjinn\fP itself.
If no occurrences of this switch appear in the argument list, \fBdjinn\fP
will check the \fBJAVA_ARGS\fP environment variable, and if it is
defined, will pass the arguments specified therein to the JVM.
.TP 5
.B -o \fIlogfile\fP
Specify an output file; the Java VM's standard output and standard
error streams will be redirected into \fIlogfile\fP. If this switch is 
omitted, the JVM's output is sent to /dev/null.
.TP 5
.B -p \fIclasspath\fP
Specify the \fIclasspath\fP for the Java Virtual Machine. If this switch is
omitted, the value of the \fBCLASSPATH\fP environment variable will be
used instead.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 5
The following example invokes the client JVM on the class \fBcom.foo.Test\fP, passing the arguments \fI10\fP and \fIHello\fP to its \fBmain()\fP function.

.B
djinn -J "-client" -p . com.foo.Test 10 Hello
.P
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 15
.B JAVA
An absolute path to a Java Virtual Machine executable.
.TP 15
.B JAVA_ARGS
Any additional arguments to pass to the JVM.
.TP 15
.B CLASSPATH
The classpath for the JVM.
.TP 15
.B PATH
The binary search path for locating the JVM executable.
