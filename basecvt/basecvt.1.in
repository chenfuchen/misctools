.SH NAME
basecvt \- interactive numeric base converter
.SH SYNOPSIS
basecvt [ -h ] [ -i \fIbase\fP ] [ -o \fIbase\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBbasecvt\fP utility converts values from one base to
another. Whitespace-separated values are read from standard input, and
the converted values are written to standard output. The input base
can be changed during conversion by entering, on its own line, the
less-than character (`<') followed by the new base. The output base
can be changed during conversion by entering, on its own line, the
greater-than character (`>') followed by the new base. To display the current
input and output bases, enter a '?' character on its own line.

Bases 2 through 36, inclusive, are supported. Digits are represented
by the decimal digits `0' through `9' and the alphabetic letters `A'
through `Z'. For example, the value 35 in base-36 is represented as `Z'.
